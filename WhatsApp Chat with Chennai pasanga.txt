Would you like help finding transport options or stay recommendations?
2/14/25, 9:06 PM - Saravana Bro Motopi: For a 2-night, 3-day trip from Chennai in April, I’d recommend Munnar or Wayanad, both of which are hill stations with trekking opportunities and pleasant weather.

April Climate in Kerala

April is summer in Kerala, with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C in most places. However, hill stations like Munnar and Wayanad are cooler, with temperatures around 15°C to 25°C, making them perfect for trekking and sightseeing.

Option 1: Munnar (Best for Scenic Views & Tea Plantations)
	•	Friday Night: Take an overnight bus/train to Munnar (around 10-12 hours).
	•	Saturday:
	•	Reach Munnar in the morning, check in to a hotel/resort.
	•	Visit Eravikulam National Park (Nilgiri Tahr spotting, moderate trekking).
	•	Explore Tea Gardens, Mattupetty Dam, Echo Point.
	•	Evening: Relax at a scenic viewpoint or try an off-road jeep safari.
	•	Sunday:
	•	Early morning trek to Meesapulimala (8km trek, breathtaking views).
	•	Visit Top Station for panoramic valley views.
	•	Depart for Chennai in the evening (overnight journey).

Option 2: Wayanad (Best for Trekking & Waterfalls)
	•	Friday Night: Take a bus/train to Kozhikode, then a cab to Wayanad (total 12-13 hours).
	•	Saturday:
	•	Reach Wayanad in the morning, check in.
	•	Trek to Edakkal Caves (ancient rock carvings).
	•	Visit Soochipara Waterfalls for a short trek.
	•	Explore Pookode Lake (boating & relaxing).
	•	Sunday:
	•	Early morning Chembra Peak Trek (heart-shaped lake, breathtaking views).
	•	Visit Banasura Sagar Dam before heading back.
	•	Depart for Chennai in the evening.
